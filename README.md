# Graphics Demos

These are graphics assignments done in Computer Graphics (CS559 Fall 2023 @ UW-Madison).
The professor's demos for this class are located [here](https://github.com/sifakis/CS559F23_Demos).
The requirements are boiled down signficantly, but still reflect the general requirement for each project. 
This site is hosted [here](https://iyadhamid.github.io/GraphicsDemos).
